# Satisfactory Tools

This project is a quick and fun endeavor to scrape data from [Satisfactory Tools](https://www.satisfactorytools.com/1.0/production) and parse it to determine optimal factory layouts in the game Satisfactory.

This is largely just a script for my own use, and this code is not tested or had too much thought put into it.  Venture in at your own risk.
