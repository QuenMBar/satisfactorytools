# Satisfactory Tools

This project is a quick and fun endeavor to scrape data from [Satisfactory Tools](https://www.satisfactorytools.com/1.0/production) and parse it to determine optimal factory layouts in the game Satisfactory.

This is largely just a script for my own use, and this code is not tested or had too much thought put into it.  Venture in at your own risk.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Scrape and parse data for factory building in Satisfactory.
- **Tool**: Utilizes selenium for web scraping.
- **Goal**: Parse a vast amount of data into usable plans for factories

## Instructions

Delete scraped_data.csv to re-scrape data from the web.  Chrome must be closed for the web-scrapper to succeed.  May need tags updated.

en-US.json is from Satisfactory's main files.  May need to be re-dropped if a big update is made.
